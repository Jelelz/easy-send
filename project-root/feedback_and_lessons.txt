Presentation Feedback:

The project is better suited to being a mobile application.
Location information should be obtained from the map, not as inputs.
The app needs a proper payment method - either the MPESA API or Stripe.
The order should be tracked through a map.
Using order information such as distance to calculate the cost of every delivery instead of a flat fee.
Ensuring that the delivered package reaches the receiver - avoid package stealing.

---------------

Extra stuff to add:

Validation for the form inputs.
Hosting the project.
Create a better README.
Using emails for features such as verifying an account or changing passwords.
